# TheCampSite
Team Biscay Bay's Blue Ocean Project! 

##Team Git Workflow 

- FORK the group repo to your personal account. This will be your own dev branch! Clone this forked repo onto your local machine to use when coding. 
- Submit work by pushing up to your personal fork (git push will work!), then submit a pull request to have it commited to the main, team repo.
- You can set the main repo as a remote upstream, that way when you run git pull you will automatically pull down the most up to date version of our group repo.
- To set up the remote upstream, run git remote add upstream https://github.com/BO-BiscayBay/TheCampSite.git.
- When working locally, make a new branch to work on whatever feature it is that day. This is CRUCIAL! Do your work in this branch, that way you can pull down the most up-to-date version of main (without any merge conflicts) before you merge your own updates.
